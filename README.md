## Hello everyone! I am Bahtiyar. You will find me right here. I dedicated my days, nights, and weekends to my coding studies. Ultimately, our success is shared. I am successful when you are successful.

## Although I am relatively new to Javascript, I am writing the front end of the site and will develop further

## Goals:
## Two of the most important goals for the future is to learn how to write literate code and develop on it.

## There is a substantial amount of documentation, a cookbook, hundreds of demos to get you started right away, a detailed calling guide, YouTube videos, online Trinket demos, and more ... it all works to create ... a fun experience.

## Everything can be achieved in this life and everything will be learned.
